Welcome to the readme!

Alright, so my mission when writing this was to try and 
simulate as much realism into this sim as I could without
having to do any aerodynamics math.

So what sort of features does this puppy have?

Apart from the regular things you'd expect from a tool 
like this. There are a few things I'm quite proud of...

First is the ability to set the TVC maximum angle rate.
Servos don't respond instantly, it takes a while to move
from one angle to the next. You can set a rate for your 
TVC. Any commands trying to tell the TVC to go faster than
that max rate will be limited down to the maximum rate.

Next, is the ability to set different noise parameters. There's
angle sensor noise (like what you'd get from a BNO055) and sensor
bias. There's also torque noise and bias. Torque noise is sort
of a stand in for random wind or forces that may want to spin
your rocket off course. The torque bias can be thought of as a
constant torque trying to rotate your rocket. There's also
TVC angle noise. We all know a TVC gimbal is not perfect. Everything
between your servo motor to your actual motor tube can flex as 
it transmits the forces of actuation. TVC Angle noise sort of simulates
that.
